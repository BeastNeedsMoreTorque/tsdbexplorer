                           Installing TSDBExplorer
                           =======================

TSDBExplorer is a Ruby on Rails application.  If you're not familiar with
Rails, please read INSTALL-GUIDE.txt for some hand-holding.

In addition to this Rails application, you'll also need:

 * A database - PostgreSQL is the only actively supported version, although
   you may have success with MySQL or even sqlite.  If you do, please let me
   know!

 * Some timetable data in CIF format.  It has been announced that this data
   will be made available by the end of 2011.  See www.openraildata.info
   where updates will be posted.

 * Real-time TRUST data.  Again, this has been announced as being available
   from April 2012 - when it is available, check www.openraildata.info.

Start the Rails server, visit http://localhost:3000/ and you'll be talked
through the necessary steps.
