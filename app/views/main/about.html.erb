<h1>About</h1>

<p>We have train timetables and real-time information on those trains.  You can search for a train to find out where it is, or you can see a list of trains that are scheduled to pass a location.</p>

<p>Historical information is available too, and we're working to produce reports so you can quickly see which trains are generally on-time, and which are a few minutes late.</p>

<p>If you want to use the data we've collected, that's fine - we're working to make that available to you for whatever you want to do with it!  And if you have questions or comments, please <%= link_to 'email us', 'mailto:opentraintimes@transporthacker.com' %>.</p>

<h2>Technical</h2>

<p>Timetable data is provided by <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/">Network Rail</a> and RSID data from <a href="http://www.atoc.org/">RSP</a>.  Real-time data is provided wholly by Network Rail and we're very grateful to them for the help they've given in letting us access the data.  It's not been easy, and there have been several hurdles, but we've persevered!</p>

<p>The timetable data is updated every night, with cancellations and alterations appearing as soon as we're told about them.</p>

<p>At the moment, we only have real-time information for the following train operating companies (TOCs):</p>

<ul>
 <li>London Overground (LO)</li>
 <li>London Midland (LM)</li>
 <li>Virgin Trains (VT)</li>
 <li>National Express East Anglia (EA)</li>
</ul>

<p>We're working on displaying this information on the site - but it's a big job, so please bear with us.</p>

<p>There are certain things you need to know the information we present to you - please <%= link_to 'read the disclaimer', :action => 'disclaimer' %> for the full picture.  Don't worry, we're not trying to misinform you!</p>
